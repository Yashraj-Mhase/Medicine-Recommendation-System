🩺 Medical Disease Prediction & Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a symptom-based medical disease prediction system built using Python and Flask.
Users enter a list of symptoms, and the system predicts a possible disease and provides basic health-related recommendations such as disease description, precautions, medications, diet, and workout suggestions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of data processing, machine learning concepts, and web application development in a healthcare-related use case.
